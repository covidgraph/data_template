# Data loader template

Template Maintainer: [Tim](https://github.com/motey)

This repository serves as a template for developers writing scripts to load data into covidgraph.

# Why we have a template

We try to have data loading scripts in a certain format to build a automated data loading pipeline.

When a developer created a script, it can be registered at https://github.com/covidgraph/motherlode
Motherlode will run the script to load the data into the DEV instance of covidgraph.
When the function and content of the data is verfied, it can be run by motherlode against the PROD instance.

# How it works

All data source scripts will be wrapped in a docker container. Motherlode is just a python script, pulling the data source docker images from docker hub and run them.

## Your tasks overview

The datasource script is responsible for following tasks:

- Download the source data
- Transform the source data
- Connect to the correct neo4j instance
- Load the data in a idempotent\* way into the database

\* "idempotent" means basicly, merge your nodes. If you script fails on half the way the first time, we want to be able to just re-run. Without duplicating all nodes that are allready loaded in the DB.

After that you need todo following things to let your script work at the covid graph

- Publish your script as docker image
- Register the script at https://github.com/covidgraph/motherlode

## Your tasks in detail

### Connect to the correct neo4j instance

Motherlode will hand over following environment variables when your data source script is called:

`ENV`: will be `PROD` or `DEV`

`GC_NEO4J_URL`: The full bolt url. example 'bolt://myneo4jhostname:7687'

`GC_NEO4J_USER`: The neo4j user

`GC_NEO4J_PASSWORD`: The neo4j password

**You have to take care that your script uses these variables to connect to the database**

## Make your image availabe

We share the scripts via docker images at https://hub.docker.com/

### Wrap your script

When you finished developeing your script, you have to "dockerize"/"container" it.
If you write you script in python, you can take this template as insporation. When you write in another laguage, the internet is full of examples :)

### Build your script and puplish it

There are multiple ways, to build and puplish your script.
The easist is to just run:

```bash
docker build -t data-my-datasource-script .
docker login --username my-docker-hub-username
docker tag data-my-datasource-script:$tag covidgraph/data-my-datasource-script:version
docker push covidgraph/data-my-datasource-script:$tag
```

To be able to puplish your script to the docker hub organization `covidgraph` you need to be member. ping [Martin](https://github.com/mpreusse) or [Tim](https://github.com/motey) for that.
Otherwise just puplish under your dockerhub username.

#### Publish via guthub actions

A more convienent way of puplishing your image is, to let github take care of that. You can use github `Actions` for that.
As an exmaple have a look at https://github.com/covidgraph/data_cord19 or ping [Tim](https://github.com/motey)

### Register your script at Motherlode

just ping [Tim](https://github.com/motey) for that and tell him the location of your docker image

Thats it! :)
